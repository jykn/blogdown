**Available to Supervise**

I am currently looking for graduate students interested in person-centred methods and approaches. These topics include:

- Use of patient-reported outcome measures
- Psychosocial interventions focused on improving quality of life
- Knowledge translation strategies for tailoring health care
- Other topics based on research interest in bio

Interested students should email me (at my UVic email) the following:

1. Current resume/CV
2. Cover letter describing your background/interest and the type of research you'd like to engage with

Please check these websites for [MSN](https://www.uvic.ca/hsd/nursing/graduate/apply/index.php) and [PhD](https://www.uvic.ca/hsd/nursing/graduate/apply-phd/index.php) requirements for nursing, and my research interest and previous publications.
