**Advisor Pledge**

Finding “fit” between the supervisor and the student is one of the most important undertakings in graduate education. An {{< staticref "pdfs/Advisor Pledge.pdf">}}advisor pledge{{< /staticref >}} has been created  to provide a shared understanding (based on the book {{< staticref "https://theprofessorisin.com/buy-the-book/">}}The Professor Is In{{< /staticref >}}). 

**Available to Supervise**

I am currently looking for graduate students interested in person-centred methods and approaches. These topics include:

-	psychosocial interventions focused on improving quality of life
- knowledge translation strategies to tailor health care

Interested students should email me (at my UVic email) the following: 
1. Current resume/CV
