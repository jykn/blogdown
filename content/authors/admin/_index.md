Dr. Jae-Yung Kwon is an Assistant Professor (tenure-track) in the School of Nursing at the University of Victoria (UVic). He co-leads the [Health Services and Systems cluster]((https://www.uvic.ca/research/centres/aging/research-resources/health-services-systems/index.php)) at the Institute on Aging and Lifelong Health and the [New Investigators Group](https://www.isoqol.org/sigs/) at the International Society of Quality of Life.

#He obtained his [PhD in Nursing](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0390462), with a subspecialization #in [Measurement, Evaluation and Research Methodology](https://ecps.educ.ubc.ca/measurement-evaluation-and-research-methodology), from #the University of British Columbia (UBC), supported by a UBC Fellowship and Cardiac Services BC. He completed his joint postdoctoral #training with the BC Ministry of Health Office of Patient-Centred Measurement and Trinity Western University, supported by the BC #SUPPORT Unit

Dr. Kwon's research program focuses on tailoring health services to promote person-centred care, aiming to meet the unique needs of individual patients with progressive or life-threatening conditions, including cancer. His research is supported by grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Canadian Frailty Network, AGE-WELL, BC SUPPORT Unit, Health Research BC, and UVic. He supervises students from both Nursing and Health Information Science.

His previous life experiences in the Korean army and nursing are chronicled in this [book](https://www.amazon.ca/Lonely-Bee-Land-Flowers-ebook/dp/B00AVZEEJC). On the side, he enjoys composing relaxing piano music (see his [youtube channel](https://youtube.com/channel/UCSi45cT6a8K-7SXaSt6SFVA/)).
