summary: I am leading a project to co-develop journey maps (visualization of patients' stories) to connect patient-reported frailty data with patients' healthcare experiences. The journey maps will be used as educational tools to assist clinicians in using patient-reported frailty assessments for improving person-centred care.

title: "Mapping patient experiences to improve person-centred care for older adults with cancer"
---

Journey mapping – the visualization of patients’ stories – is a relatively new approach in health research that can connect patients’ responses to frailty questionnaire data with their healthcare experiences. In this way, journey maps can assist clinicians in maximizing the benefits of using patient-reported frailty assessments to improve person-centred care. Learning about patient behaviours, feelings, and motivations and knowing what they experience physically, socially, and psychologically during their cancer journey helps clinicians understand potential barriers and opportunities for improving health care services across the continuum of care. This project aims to improve person-centred cancer care for older frail patients by increasing awareness of the usefulnesss of patient-reported data for addressing their unique health-related needs. This project is funded by the AGE-WELL and the Canadian Frailty Network.
