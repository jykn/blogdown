title: "Personas to Support Health Care Provider Use of Electronic Patient-Reported Outcomes in the Care of Older Adults with Cancer"
---

This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of patient partners, researchers and key stakeholders (including clinicians and health system leaders) focused on developing evidence-informed resources to support health care providers' (HCPs) use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in oncology practice. The aim of this project is to examine personas as methodological tools to inform the development of knowledge translation resources ([whiteboard video](https://youtu.be/-mUh6NDEeZQ), interactive learning module) for HCPs on the use of PROMs in the care of older adults with cancer. This project is funded by the University of Victoria and CIHR Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research Grant for effective knowledge translation to better manage the cancer trajectory of patients.

See our co-developed [Learning module](/learning-module/story.html) with older adults with cancer to educate HCPs about improving patient care, which has been uploaded to the LearningHub (an online course registry where all health authority staff across British Columbia can access).
