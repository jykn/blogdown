title: "Personas to Support Health Care Provider Use of Electronic Patient-Reported Outcomes in the Care of Older Adults with Cancer"
---

This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of patient partners, researchers and key stakeholders (including clinicians and health system leaders) focused on developing evidence-informed resources to support health care providers' (HCPs) use of electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) in oncology practice. The aim of this project is to examine user-centred design personas as methodological tools to inform the development of knowledge translation resources (whiteboard video, interactive learning module and a briefing note) for HCPs on the use of ePROs in the care of older adults with cancer. This project aligns with the purposes of the HSD internal grant and the BC SUPPORT Unit - Vancouver Island for effective knowledge translation to better manage the cancer journey of patients.
