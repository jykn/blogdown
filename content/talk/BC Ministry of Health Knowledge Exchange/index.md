abstract: Patient-reported experience and outcome measures (PREMS and PROMS) offer key insights to value in care from the patient perspective. This session discussed how PREMs and PROMs questionnaires used in British Columbia generate data to inform value and improvements in care. Three examples that have used these data sets for economic valuation, comparative patient-reported outcomes analysis, and identification of key drivers of patient experiences were showcased.
