abstract: While advances in radiation therapy have increased survival, there is limited knowledge regarding temporal changes in mental health symptoms and well-being of diverse patients and factors associated with these changes during early post diagnosis period. The aims of this study were to (1) examine heterogeneity in trajectories of patient-reported anxiety, depression and well-being of people who have cancer and are undergoing radiation therapy, and (2) identify, at the time of initial cancer diagnosis visit, which socio-demographic, physical symptoms and clinical variables are associated with such trajectories.
