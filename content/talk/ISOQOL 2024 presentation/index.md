abstract: Aims
In patients with cancer frailty, characterized across physical, mental, and social dimensions, correlates with chemotherapy toxicity, falls, and mortality. Older adults with cancer are at increased risk for frailty and pose a major challenge to the healthcare system. Our aim was to qualitatively explore older adultsâ€™ cancer experiences alongside a patient-reported frailty score, contextualizing their frailty assessment scores from treatment to post-treatment among older adults with cancer. 
Methods
Participants were recruited through community organizations across Canada from May to July 2023. Eligible participants (a) were diagnosed with cancer at or after 65 years of age, (b) had completed or were undergoing cancer treatment, and (c) resided in Canada. During the online semi-structured interviews, participants described their cancer treatment and post-treatment experiences, completed the physical, mental and social health items from the Comprehensive Frailty Assessment Instrument (CFAI) and subsequently elaborated on their responses. Interview data were analyzed qualitatively.
Results
Eleven adults (six women, five men) diagnosed with cancer between 65 to 79 years of age participated. Participants reported varying degrees of frailty risks at treatment and post-treatment, along with distinct cancer experiences. Based on the CFAI scores, we categorized participants into four frailty risk groups: low (n=5), moderate to low (n=2), moderate (n=2), and moderate to high (n=2). Risks for frailty were stable for those in the low risk category, decreased for the moderate to low and moderate groups, and stable or increased for the high to moderate group. Factors associated with frailty risk during treatment included fatigue, depressive symptoms, stress, and diminished social engagement. While many participants experienced reduced frailty risks post-treatment, some continued to face challenges such as long-lasting side effects, slow recovery and cancer recurrence worries. Notably, even among patients categorized in the same frailty risk group, the narratives of their physical, mental, and social health throughout their cancer journeys varied significantly.
Conclusion
Utilizing patient-reported measures to assess frailty can initiate conversations about frailty risks among patients, families, and healthcare teams. This approach may empower patients consider and communicate about their frailty risks, while potentially facilitating improved access to necessary supports and resources.

summary: This short online video presentation at ISOQOL focuses on integrating patient-reported outcome measure scores with patients' narratives in journey maps to identify opportunities to enhance patient-clinician communication and understanding of frailty among older adults with cancer.
