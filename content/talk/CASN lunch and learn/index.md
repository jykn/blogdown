abstract:
There is increasing discussion about machine learning as providing a more nuanced understanding of patient-reported data. However, the key challenge is how to communicate the knowledge from these complex algorithms that are understandable for clinicians and nurses to act upon in their practice for individual patients. This presentation will demonstrate (through a series of mixed-methods research projects) how nurses can interpret and use patient-reported data for the individual patients we are caring for. 

The first half of the presentation will cover latent class analysis (a type of machine learning technique) to identify subgroups of patients who are experiencing different patterns in patient-reported outcomes. The second half of the presentation will cover how to use the results of latent class analysis via personas (hypothetical representations of patients that incorporate life stories) and journey maps (visualization of patients’ healthcare encounters over time) as innovative knowledge translation tools for improving care. The audience may gain better insights into the nursing role (in the context of machine learning) to better understand patients’ unique life situations and facilitate better patient-clinician communication to meet their changing needs.
