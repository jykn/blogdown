summary: An assumption in many trajectory analyses is that there is a single population following a single average trajectory. However, symptom trajectories are not expected to be homogeneous in diverse populations. This presentation will describe the process undertaken for using latent class growth mixture models and how they can be used as valuable tools to classify unobserved trajectories of patients' health outcomes.
