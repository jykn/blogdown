abstract:  While patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) can help healthcare providers (HCPs) better understand patients’ concerns, their uptake in practice has been slow and ineffective, in part, because numeric PROM scores can be difficult to interpret. Personas, hypothetical representations of patients, can be used as an innovative strategy to support HCPs use of PROMs in their practice. These personas embody patients’ life stories making them a valuable tool for demonstrating the benefits of using PROM scores to inform shared decision-making. The aim of this study was to develop personas as a knowledge translation strategy to support HCPs’ use of PROMs in cancer care.

summary: This short presentation at [ISOQOL 2022](https://www.isoqol.org/participate-in-isoqol-2022/) focuses on using personas that illustrated the lived experience of older adults so that HCPs gain awareness about how PROMs can provide contextual information about patients' unique life situation.
