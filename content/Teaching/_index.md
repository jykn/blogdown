**Teaching Philosophy**

My teaching philosophy is based on the scholarship of appreciative inquiry, which provides a supportive environment for learning by focusing on one's strengths. This philosophy is translated into teaching methods that I developed called the CRC approach, which focuses on three key areas of thinking: critical, reflective and creative (see {{% staticref "pdfs/Teaching Statement.pdf"%}}teaching statement{{% /staticref %}} for details).
